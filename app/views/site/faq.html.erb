<h2 class="content-header">FAQ</h2>

<div class="faq-entry">
	<h3>I get "fatal: no matching remote head" when trying to clone a repository</h3>
	<p>Most likely the repository you are trying to clone is empty, and the error
  message is git's friendly way of telling you that. See below (or by clicking 
  "more info" next to the repository's "push url") for info on how to push to it.</p>
</div> 

<div class="faq-entry">
	<h3>What is the SSH key fingerprint of the server I am pushing to?</h3>
	<p> The SSH key fingerprint of the <%= GitoriousConfig['gitorious_host'] %> server is:<br />
  <code><%= GitoriousConfig["ssh_fingerprint"] %></code></p>
</div>


<div class="faq-entry">
	<h3>How do I point my local Git repository at Gitorious?</h3>
	<p>Easiest way is to put something like the following in your <code>.git/config</code> 
  		file of the repository you wish to push:
	<pre>[remote "origin"]
       url = <%= GitoriousConfig['gitorious_user'] -%>@<%= GitoriousConfig['gitorious_host'] -%>:<em>project</em>/<em>repository.git</em>
       fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "master"]
       remote = origin
       merge = refs/heads/master</pre>
  and then <code>git push origin master</code> to push the code to Gitorious.</p>
	<p>You can also just run "<code>git push <%= GitoriousConfig['gitorious_user'] -%>@<%= GitoriousConfig['gitorious_host'] -%>:tumbline/mainline.git</code>", or
  you can setup a remote by doing the following (add --fetch to the add call to 
  get the config from above):
  <pre>
  git remote add origin <%= GitoriousConfig['gitorious_user'] -%>@<%= GitoriousConfig['gitorious_host'] -%>:<em>project</em>/<em>repository.git</em>
  # to push the master branch to the origin remote we added above:
  git push origin master 
  # after that you can just do:
  git push
  </pre></p>
</div>

<div class="faq-entry">
	<h3>What version of Git is Gitorious running?</h3>
	<p><code><%= git_version %></code></p>
</div>

<div class="faq-entry">
	<h3>How did my avatar/mugshot end up on this site? I am not even registered!</h3>
	<p> We use <a href="http://gravatar.com">Gravatar.com</a> for user avatars. If you
  have not registered on Gitorious, someone else may have pushed commits with you
  name and/or email in them which we in turn hash and send to to Gravatar.com to
  find an avatar image. If you want it changed you should either register and 
  upload an avatar of your own, or go to Gravatar.com and change it.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-entry">
	<h3>Why do I need to upload my public SSH key?</h3>
	<p>When you push to a Git repository, your public key is how we authenticate 
  you and check if have the permissions required to do a commit to a given repository</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-entry">
	<h3>I have Windows. How do I generate the required SSH key?</h3>
	<p>The recommended way to use Git on Windows is the 
  <%= link_to "msysGit", "http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/" -%> version. It comes bundled
  with minimal Cygwin support. When you finish installing it, you will have a "Git Bash"
  icon in your desktop. Double click to open it and now you can use known Linux-like
  commands, such as <code>"ssh-keygen -t rsa"</code>. Just press 'Return' in every question
  it asks and you will finally have your pair of keys under ".ssh". For example, type
  <code>"cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"</code>. Thats is the public key that you are required to
  copy and paste into your account on Gitorious.</p>
