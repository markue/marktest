= NEWS

This document lists new features in the Gitorious source code. If you
are looking for detailed information about invidiual commits, use the
Git log. Oldest news at the bottom, newest at the top.

=== New messaging API

No longer depend on ActiveMessaging for asynchronous processing. We
now support several kinds of messaging backends, and a simple API for
adding new ones. Refer to lib/gitorious/messaging for more information
on the new API.

=== Improved SSL

The gitorious.yml configuration file now has a configuration setting
that allows the control SSL usage. You either enable it (default) or
disable it. When SSL is enabled, Gitorious will force SSL for any page
as long as a user is logged in. Additionally, any page that takes user
input (whether the user is logged in or not) will require the use of
SSL through a redirect. If SSL is disabled, it will not be used
anywhere. It is strongly encouraged to use SSL. If you don't have an
SSL certificate, create a self-signed one.

=== Re-write of event handling, scheduled for master 2011-02-11

Gitorious used to create event records in the database for each commit
event. This created an enormous amount of unnecessary data in the
database, which slowed down database performance, especially when
index updates happen, on each insert/delete.

We no longer store the commits as events, rather use git to fetch
these on demand (using caching, of course). There's a new event type
with action Action::PUSH_SUMMARY, which contains the metadata required
to fetch the correct events from git. In this process, the processing
of push events was rewritten.

Each push event will now create a "push event" and/or a "meta event",
illustrated by the following table:


Should we generate a push event?
|      | CREATE | UPDATE | DELETE |
| tag  | no     | no     | no     |
| head | no     | yes    | no     |

Should we generate a "meta" event?
|      | CREATE | UPDATE | DELETE |
| tag  | yes    | no     | yes    |
| head | yes    | no     | yes    |


=== Links to tags and branches changes - 2011-02-09

The links to branches and commits from the trees are now changed to
point to the respective trees, not commit logs as it has been in the
past. Related - when creating new tags the news bulletin now links to
the tree for that tag, rather than to its commit log which makes no
sense, and also causes Gitorious to crash.

=== Pull/push Gitorious repositories - 2011-01-27

Gitorious now lets users clone the wiki repository for a project. This
way they can update the wiki locally (all the files in the repository
is in Markdown format) and push their changes back to gitorious.org.

In the same way events are logged in the project when someone edits a
wiki page through the web interface, changes will be logged when you
push them to Gitorious. Gitorious do not currently impose any
restrictions on using branches and tags, so use Git however you see
fit to work with your repository.
