events:
* need to create user-less events even we don't find matching users, otherwise it gets weird whenever there's commits from non-registered gitorious users (or users commit from another email).
- maybe save name+email in events table in that case, so we can hook them up to a user later if needed.
* .hooks symlink need to go to $deploy_to/current, not the release dir

new-ui:
* show outstanding mergerequests on dashboard
* tweak fonts-sizes and line-heights
* Clone stats graph on repositories#index
* popular & active projects on frontpage
* make the top-header smaller (move gitorious logo to footer?)

(in no particular order)

two from Yurii:
1) show commits actually merged for merge request after actual merge (I see them on open request, but do not on merged one) 
2) provide clone url on every repo browsing page, so I can get url to pull from even if I am reading a commit

* tree browser: deal better with funny characters: http://gitorious.org/projects/avara/repos/mainline/trees/master
* if you comment on a specific commit, you should get redirected back there

>  If you do `git archive --format=tar --prefix=myproject/ HEAD | gzip >
>  myproject.tar.gz`, when .gitattributes specifies files that have
>  export-subst, it will expand keywords such as $Format:%cd$. Gitorious'
>  "Download as gzipped tarball" apparently does not do this and I think
>  it'd be pretty nice if it did.

* Deal gracefully with markdown errors (and/or look into using the other markdown libary instead)
* Markdownify atom feed body for projects.atom
* Make the fact that you _can_ clone/fork any repo more visible, maybe reword it since people confuse it with local cloning
* Show the most recent mergerequests on users dashboard so they can track them
* Make the archive download an external little mongrel/rack thing, and store the result per sha1
* Comments on MergeRequests and/or votes (or just comments when you resolve)
* only load scriptacolous+friends when needed
* git-blame rendering?
* Reword /about page
* mail the user when someone adds him as a comitter
* expire fragment caches for project+repos on deletion
*a Tone down the "owner" of a repository, or implement a proper "mirror" project type.
*b be able to mark a project as a "mirror"
* Nicer diff stats
* more interesting project stats on frontpage
* parse git submodule data and link to project if submodule is in gitorious
* add mainline as a remote branch in clones
* timezone support
* Email source_repository owner about merge_request changes
* Get rid of all the mocking in the controller tests, or at least clean it up
* Nag project owners with no commits to the mainline repos after a week or two
* gitk-style branch view
* Projects can add multiple "pages", not just the index description
* paginate comments
* OpenID login
* Clean up in commit diff CSS
* graph Repository#parent relationships properly
* (A RemoteRepository class for repositories hosted elsewhere?)
* Auto-remove cloned repositories that havent been committed to after 7 days?
* Refactor the Task/queue system
* A "Status" field for a project (though a wiki-frontpage makes this unneeded-ish)
* improve commenting and comments visibility
* handle mising/wrong SHA1s gracefully in browser
* parse SHA1s in commits+comments
* Detect renames etc when showing a commit
* Always add a "mainline-upstream" branch that track the mainline repos automagically to clones
---

a ProjectMirror that sucks in svn repositories. They need to be differentiated form normal projects (don't display owner etc, since it's a mirror). Also, the mainline repository should probably be immutable so people can commit changes to the actual mirror.

Groups may be a better alternative to allowing multiple repositories in a project, so a Group (or Product?) has many projects.
